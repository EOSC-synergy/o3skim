Prerequisites
==================================

To run the project as container, you need the following systems and container technologies:

 - **Build machine** with docker_ in case you want/need to build your own image.
 - **Runtime machine** with udocker_ and access to the data to skim.

In case you do not want to create your image, last images are uploaded in dockerhub
at synergyimk_.

.. rubric:: Note udocker_ cannot build containers but run them.
